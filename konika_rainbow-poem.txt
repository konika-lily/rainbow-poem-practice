My Rainbow and the white unicorn poem-konika
sky is blue
sun is orange
soil is red
forest is green
violets are purple
sunshine is yellow
electricity is indigo
my heart is pink

Rainbows give me goosebumps,
I love them.
They are so big

I think they are angel's brows

And there is this unicorns...

and there are three fairies
